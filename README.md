# ShaVi-1.0

## Description

Full waveform inversion (FWI) is a technique used in studying underground struc
tures through seismic data. It helps create a detailed image of what‚Äôs beneath the
Earth‚Äôs surface. However, implementing FWI can be tough due to its complex math
and high computational demands. To make it easier, we made ShaVi-1.0, a 2D acous-
tic FWI tool. It uses OpenMP API to handle computations and has a user-friendly
interface for easy use on regular computers.
ShaVi-1.0‚Äôs core code is in C language, designed so users can adjust parts as needed.
The Graphical User Interface (GUI), made in Python, comes with handy features like
real-time plotting and updates on the process status. It also has message and warning
boxes for a smooth experience. The GUI includes a toolbox for generating acquisition
geometry and plotting source-receiver locations. This GUI not only makes using the
tool easier but also lets you analyze results in real-time.

## Usage

Provide instructions and examples for use. Include screenshots as needed.

To add a screenshot, create an `assets/images` folder in your repository and upload your screenshot to it. Then, using the relative filepath, add it to your README using the following syntax:

    ```md
    ![alt text](assets/images/screenshot.png)
    ```

## Credits

List your collaborators, if any, with links to their GitHub profiles.

If you used any third-party assets that require attribution, list the creators with links to their primary web presence in this section.

If you followed tutorials, include links to those here as well.

## License

The last section of a high-quality README file is the license. This lets other developers know what they can and cannot do with your project. If you need help choosing a license, refer to [https://choosealicense.com/](https://choosealicense.com/).

üèÜ The previous sections are the bare minimum, and your project will ultimately determine the content of this document. You might also want to consider adding the following sections.

## Badges

Badges aren't necessary, per se, but they demonstrate street cred. Badges let other developers know that you know what you're doing. Check out the badges hosted by [shields.io](https://shields.io/). You may not understand what they all represent now, but you will in time.

## Features

If your project has a lot of features, list them here.

## How to Contribute

If you created an application or package and would like other developers to contribute it, you can include guidelines for how to do so. The [Contributor Covenant](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/) is an industry standard, but you can always write your own if you'd prefer.

## Tests

Go the extra mile and write tests for your application. Then provide examples on how to run them here.
