Method 1: Utilize the GUI Interface
To begin the inversion process, execute the "Shavi-1.0.py" script located in the "bin" directory. 
The GUI provides a user-friendly interface, making the implementation easier. Refer to the tutorial 
link available in the help section for step-by-step instructions on how to use the GUI effectively.

Method 2: Direct Access to Code
Alternatively, you can directly access the code by running the "fwi.exe" executable also present in 
the "bin" directory. 

Inversion requires you to have the necessary files, including parameter, source information, 
acquisition geometry, and observed data.

Furthermore, a folder named "synthetic data generator" is provided, which offers a useful tool to produce 
synthetic data for synthetic models.
